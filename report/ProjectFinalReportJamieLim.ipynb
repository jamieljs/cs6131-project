    "There has been evidence of humans (or our ancestors) cooking from hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of years ago. Since then, cooking has spread all over the world, while also becoming more diversified and complicated than simply starting a campfire and putting one's latest catch over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With increasing awareness on various medical conditions, environmental concerns and religious practices, adhering to dietary restrictions/preferences has become an essential part of cooking. After decades of gradual decline of home cooking as urbanisation took place and people became busier, the pandemic was also a key factor in encouraging people to cook at home more regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether someone is a novice wanting to learn how to cook or a master chef with years of experience, recipes are an important tool in cooking. Finding the right recipe for one's purposes is no easy task, with many different factors to be considered such as the skill level required, the amount of time and effort needed, dietary restrictions or even simply personal taste. Moreover, there are social benefits to be reaped by having a global community where people can share their recipes, including understanding and appreciation across cultures, finding new friends to bond with over a shared interest in food, or even creating delicious new fusion dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, an online recipe platform where people around the world can contribute and discover new culinary creations would be extremely useful and convenient. An RDBMS system can efficiently store the large volume of information needed, including details such as ingredients and instructions for recipes, while being able to model the complex relationships between users, recipes, ingredients and other relevant entities. An RDBMS system can also efficiently handle various operations on such a platform, like complex recipe queries when browsing, creation/modification/deletion of recipes, or adding and removing from lists. Thus, this project aims to use RDBMS to create a web application that serves as a repository of recipes."

    "Users should register and log in to their accounts in order to access the full experience of the app, although basic functionalities are also available for users that do not have an account. Storing of personal information/preferences (such as usernames) is not required for users that are not logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For registered **users**, their account will be assigned a unique *user ID* number for identification upon registration. During the registration process, they must provide a *username* that they want to use, which they can edit over time as long as it does not clash with another existing username. Users must also provide a *password* during registration, which will be hashed (transformed in order to ensure security) and then stored in the database, together with the password *salt* (used for hashing). Moreover, *user descriptions* will be stored for each user, should they wish to customise their profile. Users can <ins>follow</ins> other users, excluding themselves (e.g. their friends, or people whose recipes they like and want to keep tabs on). Each user can follow any number of users, and can be followed by any number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want users to be able to keep track of the **ingredients** that they currently own. Each ingredient has a unique *ingredient ID* number, while the *ingredient names* serve as a way for users to identify and differentiate the ingredients. Each user can have some ingredients in their <ins>inventory</ins>, and each ingredient can belong to multiple users' inventories. A user may have bought a certain ingredient a few times separately, so they can own a few different manufacturing batches of the same ingredient. Hence, there is a list of *expiry dates* associated with each ingredient in a user's inventory. This allows users to keep track of whether their ingredients have already expired and should be removed, or whether they still can use a particular ingredient in certain recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recipes** are identified by their *recipe ID* numbers. Each recipe has a *name* and *description* which users can see when they are browsing the list of recipes. Each recipe is <ins>created by</ins> exactly one user, and the *date* of creation is stored in the database. Each user can create any number of recipes. The creator may provide an *image url* for users to see what the recipe end-product looks like. The creator can also specify information to help users when deciding on a recipe / cooking, such as the *difficulty level* of the recipe, the approximate *time taken* to cook based on the recipe and the *number of portions* that the recipe creates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipes <ins>use</ins> ingredients. For every ingredient that a recipe uses, the *quantity* used is stored (e.g. \"1 cup\" of water, \"500 grams\" of flour). Recipes must use at least one ingredient, while ingredients can be used in any number of recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipes also <ins>have</ins> **instructions**, which consist of a *title* (main text of instruction) and *subtitle* (for any additional information). Each instruction belongs to exactly one recipe, and each recipe must have at least one instruction (usually multiple) that must be followed in a certain order. Since the recipe creator may decide to reorder instructions, the *order* of the instruction in the list must be stored and may be modified, so it cannot be used to identify the instructions. Hence, for each instruction, an *instruction ID* number is used to identify the instruction with respect to its recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app has a <ins>rating system</ins> where users can assign *scores* (integer from 1 to 5 inclusive) to recipes based on how much they like the recipe. Users can rate any number of recipes, and recipes can be rated by any number of users. The *overall rating* of a recipe is calculated by taking the average of all the user-rated scores for this particular recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can <ins>bookmark</ins> recipes that they want to access easily in the future. Users can bookmark any number of recipes, and recipes can be bookmarked by any number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "When browsing for recipes, users can use **tags** to filter their search. Each tag has a unique *tag ID* number, as well as a *name* displayed to users. Each tag can be one of three different types: a \"generic\" tag with no other information stored, a **cuisine** tag or a **dietary restriction** tag.\n",
    "\n",

    "The presence of (a) certain ingredient(s) may <ins>exclude</ins> some dietary restrictions, preventing people with these dietary restrictions from trying any recipes that use this ingredient. Each dietary restriction tag must be assigned to at least one ingredient that it is associated with, so that the tag can be appropriately removed from recipes that contain the ingredient(s). Each ingredient may be assigned to any number of dietary restrictions."

    "After completing the project, I can better appreciate the usefulness of relational databases, especially for use cases where complex data needs to be organised, stored and retrieved in a consistent and efficient way. For example, in the context of a recipe database, a relational database like MySQL helps with organising and retrieving data related to ingredients, instructions, and user information in a structured and fast way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also learned about the challenges of working with unstructured data, such as online recipes which are often found in blogs. While some projects may involve scraping data from webpages using scripts, it was difficult in my project due to the varying structure of webpage layouts and the inconsistent format of recipes or their instructions across different bloggers or even within one blogger's posts. This experience has made me aware of the complexities involved in dealing with unstructured data in the real world, even for a project using RDBMS (which is useful for structured data). I learned to be adaptable and patient while trying to be as efficient as possible in data extraction and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was difficult to make my browse query into a stored procedure as I had both variables (from the query) and column names (for sorting) to pass to the SELECT query. I ended up having to use a prepared statement for that, and concatenate each variable separately instead of just including the variable name in the query string.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also challenging to ensure input validation for forms that were self-declared (implemented for the purpose of submitting a form without reloading the page). It took me some time to understand how the forms work and how to make the UI behave as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, I also gained insights into my chosen topic (recipes) and the considerations that need to be included in a recipe. I realized that beyond just ingredients and instructions, factors such as cooking time or serving size are also important aspects of a comprehensive recipe. This broadened my understanding of the importance of knowing context and details (business rules, attributes) of the \"problem\" I am trying to solve before working out a solution (to ensure all information is captured in the database representation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project experience will be valuable in future projects as I have become more familiar with SQL and learned how to use MySQL with Python, as well as gained hands-on experience with Flask and HTML/CSS/JS. I have learned more about how the project front-end and back-end (database) can be integrated to create an interactive web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found assignment 1 / project phases / ISSLs very helpful in managing my time effectively. Timeline management was indeed crucial in ensuring that the project progressed smoothly and was not so rushed towards the end like in my previous CS projects. This experience has reinforced the importance of planning and doing work in advance, and I will carry this lesson forward into future projects to ensure better time management and reduce last-minute stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I have gained practical skills and understanding in designing and implementing databases, working with unstructured data, and using Flask for building web applications. This project has also taught me the importance of time management in project execution. Overall, the project experience will be useful in my future endeavours in CS."
